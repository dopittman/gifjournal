# GifJournal - MERN WebApp

## What is this?
GifJournal is a web application that I am creating using the MERN stack with the purpose of creating a fast, optimized, and fun way for users to create an online journal using GIFs insead of paragraphs. The goal is to create a safe and secure service that users can quickly access, post their journal log, and continue on with their day.

## Why are you making this?
- I feel that journaling and keeping logs of your life events provides people with an easy way to relive and remember their important moments. GifJournal works by combining short journal logs with GIFs allowing users to quickly create posts that will quickly capture their feelings at the time.

- To utilize many of the technologies and practice what I have been learning to create a full-stack web application that is secure, responsive, and user-friendly. This includes the MERN stack as well as design, styling, SEO, and many other facets of web development.

## What's next?
